# Food Image Classification using TensorFlow and Python

## Project Overview
This project focuses on image classification of food items using a deep learning approach. A CNN model is built to classify 10 different categories of food images:

Categories: Ice Cream, Samosa, Chicken Curry, Waffles, Sushi, Hamburger, Pancakes, Pizza, Dumplings, Fried Rice.
The data is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets, followed by building and training a CNN. After training, the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix.
